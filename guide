Material Estimate Component — Quick Start Guide

Overview
- This document helps a new developer run the project locally for the first time.
- Repo contains a Flutter app (root), platform folders, and a simple Python `backend` in `backend/`.

1) Clone the repository
- Using HTTPS (recommended):
  git clone https://github.com/BMadhushan18/Material_Estimate_Component_Bawantha.git
- Example (Windows cmd):
  cd C:\\path\\to\\workspace
  git clone https://github.com/BMadhushan18/Material_Estimate_Component_Bawantha.git

Commands to run:
```
cd C:\\path\\to\\workspace
git clone https://github.com/BMadhushan18/Material_Estimate_Component_Bawantha.git
cd Material_Estimate_Component_Bawantha
```

2) Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (stable): https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
  - Add Flutter `bin` to your PATH.
  - Verify with:
```
flutter doctor
```
- Android SDK / Android Studio (for Android builds and emulators):
  - Ensure `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` (or `ANDROID_HOME`) points to your SDK directory.
  - Accept licenses (Windows cmd):
```
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```
- Java JDK (matching Android toolchain) — usually JDK 11 is OK for recent Flutter versions.
- Xcode (macOS only) for iOS builds.
- Python 3.8+ (for backend): https://www.python.org/downloads/
  - Confirm Python version:
```
python --version
pip --version
```
- Git installed and available in PATH.

3) Install project dependencies

Flutter app dependencies:
```
cd Material_Estimate_Component_Bawantha
flutter pub get
```

Backend dependencies (Python):
Windows (cmd) example:
```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
macOS / Linux example:
```
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) Configure Android-specific settings (if building for Android)

Create or update `android\\local.properties` (Windows example):
```
echo sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\<YourUser>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk > android\\local.properties
```
Replace `<YourUser>` with your Windows username. If using Android Studio, it will generate this file automatically.

5) Run the backend

From repo root (Windows cmd):
```
cd backend
venv\\Scripts\\activate   # if you created the venv as shown above
python main.py
```

If the backend accepts environment variables (check `backend/main.py`), run like:
```
set FLASK_ENV=development
set PORT=5000
python main.py
```
(Use `export` on macOS/Linux instead of `set`.)

6) Run the Flutter app

List devices and emulators:
```
flutter devices
```

Run on default device:
```
flutter run
```

Run on specific device (example):
```
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

Run on Windows desktop (if project supports it):
```
flutter run -d windows
```

If you need to point the app to your local backend (common during development), set the API base URL in the app's config or use a debug flag inside `lib/` — search for constants or environment handling in `lib/`.

7) Build release artifacts

Android APK (release):
```
flutter build apk --release
```
Output location: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

Android App Bundle (AAB):
```
flutter build appbundle --release
```

iOS (macOS required):
```
flutter build ios --release
```

Windows (desktop):
```
flutter build windows --release
```

8) Common troubleshooting (commands and tips)

- If plugins are causing build or codegen errors:
```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```
- If Android SDK licenses missing:
```
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```
- If build fails and you need verbose logs:
```
flutter run -v
```
- If Gradle issues on Android, try using the wrapper from `android/`:
```
cd android
gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```
- For Python backend errors, verify venv activation and reinstall requirements:
```
venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

9) Notes for maintainers
- Backend is at `backend/main.py` and requirements in `backend/requirements.txt`.
- Flutter entry point is `lib/main.dart`.
- Platform-specific code lives in `android/`, `ios/`, `windows/`, etc.

10) Next steps I can help with
- Convert this `guide` into `GUIDE.md` (Markdown) for nicer formatting.
- I can run `flutter pub get` and install backend requirements here if you want me to execute commands in this environment.

If you'd like me to make a Markdown version or run the setup commands now, tell me which option you prefer.
